The el_demand_adjusted data is data extracted from the PyPSA-Eur-Sec-Path model [1], a model of the european power system
for 2020 to 2050 in 5-year intervals. The PyPSA-Eur-Sec-Path model relies on demand data from ENTSO-E and prepared by Open Power Systems 
Data [2]. However, this data is for a single year (2015). To obtain the effects of electrification in 2030, 2040 and 2050,
the adjusted demand is extracted from PyPSA-Eur-Sec-Path. The el_damnd_adjusted data is the sum of the loads and links '
for each relevant country in each snapshot. 
For the input data (the "demand" files in this folder), the demand is constant across the years. With this adjusted data,
the demand accurately increases with electrification over the years.
