The demand data is the same as used in the PyPSA-Eur-Sec-Path model, a model of the european power system for 2020 
to 2050 in 5-year intervals. The demand is input data to this model, sourced from ENTSO-E and prepared by 
Open Power Systems Data [1]. Description of the data for the model is found in the supplementary materials [2], and 
the datafiles are sourced from the archive of input data from the PyPSA-Eur-Sec-Path model [3].
All demand is modeled on 2015, and there is no difference between the datasets [2].
